# explanation
these are previous attempts for cryptic splice site identification
exp_1 -> search for MYBPC3 mutation in a wider context -> did not produce a lot of new splice variation, not a great example
exp_2 -> finding optimal mutation position for tp53 gene -> used old delta score method by taking just the maximum predicted splice site score and tracking the difference at that position/ does not capture all splice site changes
exp_3 -> search again with modified score tracking multiple splice site change events across the entire sequence -> used hg19
