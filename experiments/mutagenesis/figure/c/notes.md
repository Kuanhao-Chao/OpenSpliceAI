# Data
MYBPC3 gene (>chr11:47358709-47370709(-) (hg19))-> a 2k sequence which contains the mutations, with 10k flanking. The mutation is applied at the midpoint (position 47364709, G>A)

# Method
Mutate the target base and examine the difference in acceptor site scores across the region. Similar to SpliceAI figure 2A, examine the scores at the two acceptor site gain and loss events, and compare with SpliceAI's original score differences. 

# Visualization
We visualize the gain and loss scores tabularly.
