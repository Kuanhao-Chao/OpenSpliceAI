# Data
TP53 gene, full length (chr17:7,570,739-7,591,808(-) (hg19)) -> 21069 bp sequence + 10k flanking context. 

# Method
First, search for cryptic splicing events from initial scan and 


Second, mutate various sites in

Mutate the target base and examine the difference in acceptor site scores across the region. Similar to SpliceAI figure 2A, examine the scores at the two acceptor site gain and loss events, and compare with SpliceAI's original score differences. 

# Visualization
We visualize the gain and loss scores tabularly.
