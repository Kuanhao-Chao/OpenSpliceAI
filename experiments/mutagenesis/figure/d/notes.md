# Data
Full CFTR gene
(MYBPC3 was also tested, but too small)

# Results
An exon plot showing where OpenSpliceAI identifies the splice sites with score >0.5 vs. SpliceAI

# Usage
predict_sites.py -> generate the raw score plot for every base. 
commands.md -> run these to generate the filtered BED files for the prediction + exon plot
plot_exon.py -> plots the exon plot on top of the score plot
