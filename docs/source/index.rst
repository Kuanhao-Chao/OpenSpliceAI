OpenSpliceAI is an open‐source, efficient, and modular framework for splice site prediction. It is a reimplementation and extension of SpliceAI (Jaganathan et al., 2019) built on the modern PyTorch framework. OpenSpliceAI provides researchers with a user‐friendly suite of tools for studying transcript splicing—from creating training datasets and training models to predicting splice sites and assessing the impact of genetic variants.

|

Key Features
------------

- **Modern and Retrainable Framework:**  
  Built on Python 3.7 and PyTorch, OpenSpliceAI overcomes the limitations of older TensorFlow/Keras implementations. Its modular design enables easy retraining on species-specific data with just a few commands.

- **Up-to-Date and Cross-Species Models:**  
  In addition to a new human model retrained on the latest GRCh38 human genome and MANE annotations, OpenSpliceAI comes with pre-trained models for mouse, thale cress (Arabidopsis), honey bee, and zebrafish—empowering researchers to study splicing across diverse species.

- **Variant Effect Prediction:**  
  OpenSpliceAI not only predicts splice sites but also assesses the impact of genetic variants (SNPs and INDELs) on splicing. Its variant subcommand calculates “delta” scores that quantify changes in splice site strength due to mutations.

- **Efficiency and Scalability:**  
  With improved processing speeds, lower memory usage, and efficient GPU utilization, OpenSpliceAI can handle large genomic regions and whole-genome predictions on a single high-end GPU.

|

Who Should Use OpenSpliceAI?
-----------------------------

- **Human Genomics Researchers:**  
  Use the newly retrained OpenSpliceAI-MANE model for highly accurate splice site predictions based on the latest human annotations.

- **Comparative and Non-Human Genomics:**  
  Whether you’re studying mouse, zebrafish, honey bee, or thale cress, OpenSpliceAI offers models pre-trained on multiple species—and the ability to train your own models—ensuring broad applicability.

- **Variant Analysts:**  
  If you need to predict how genetic variants affect splicing, OpenSpliceAI’s variant subcommand provides detailed delta scores and positional information to assess functional impacts.

|

What OpenSpliceAI Does
----------------------

- **Data Preprocessing (create-data):**  
  Converts genome FASTA and annotation (GFF/GTF) files into one-hot encoded datasets (HDF5 format) for training and testing.

- **Model Training (train):**  
  Trains deep residual convolutional neural networks on the preprocessed datasets. OpenSpliceAI supports training from scratch and employs adaptive learning rate schedulers and early stopping.

- **Transfer Learning (transfer):**  
  Fine-tunes a pre-trained human model for other species, reducing training time and improving performance on species with limited data.

- **Model Calibration (calibrate):**  
  Adjusts model output probabilities to better reflect true splice site likelihoods, enhancing prediction accuracy.

- **Prediction (predict):**  
  Uses trained models to generate splice site predictions from FASTA sequences, outputting BED files with donor and acceptor site coordinates.

- **Variant Analysis (variant):**  
  Annotates VCF files with delta scores and positions to evaluate the impact of genetic variants on splicing.

|

Why OpenSpliceAI?
-----------------

1. **Easy-to-Retrain Framework:**  
   By leveraging PyTorch, OpenSpliceAI simplifies the retraining process and overcomes compatibility issues associated with older frameworks. Two simple commands allow you to retrain the model on any species of interest.

2. **Updated Human Model:**  
   The pre-trained human model has been updated from GRCh37 to GRCh38 using the latest MANE annotations, ensuring you work with the most current and precise genomic data.

3. **Cross-Species Versatility:**  
   With models pre-trained on multiple species—including human, mouse, thale cress, honey bee, and zebrafish—OpenSpliceAI caters to a broad range of genomic research applications.

4. **Variant Impact Prediction:**  
   OpenSpliceAI can analyze the effects of genetic variants on splicing, providing detailed “delta” scores that highlight changes in splice site strength due to mutations.

.. OpenSpliceAI is an open-source version of SpliceAI, a highly accurate splice site prediction system that provides researchers with a user-friendly framework to study transcript splicing. It comes with models pre-trained on various species, including humans (MANE database), mice, thale cress (Arabidopsis), honey bees, and zebrafish. Additionally, the OpenSpliceAI is capable of processing genetic variants in VCF format to predict their impact on splicing.


.. |

.. Why OpenSpliceAI❓
.. =======================

.. 1. **Easy-to-retrain framework**: Transitioning from the outdated Python 2.7, along with older versions of TensorFlow and Keras, the OpenSpliceAI is built on Python 3.7 and leverages the powerful PyTorch library. This simplifies the retraining process significantly. Say goodbye to compatibility issues and hello to efficiency — retrain your models with just two simple commands.
.. 2. **Retrained on new dataset**: SpliceAI is great, but OpenSpliceAI makes it even better! The newly pretrained SpliceAI-Human model is updated from GRCh37 to GRCh38 human genome and integrates the latest MANE (Matched Annotation from NCBI and EMBL-EBI) annotations, ensuring that research is supported by the most up-to-date and precise genomic data available.
.. 3. **Retrained on various species**:  Concerned that the SpliceAI model does not generalize to your study species because you are not studying humans? No problem! The OpenSpliceAI is released with models pretrained on various species, including human MANE, mouse, thale cress, honey bee, and zebrafish.
.. 4. **Predict the impact of genetic variants on splicing**: Similar to SpliceAI, the OpenSpliceAI can take genetic variants in VCF format and predict the impact of these variants on splicing with any of the pretrained models.

.. OpenSpliceAI is open-source, free, and combines the ease of Python with the power of PyTorch for accurate splicing predictions.

.. |

.. Who is it for❓
.. ====================================

.. 1. If you want to study splicing in humans, just use the newly pretrained human SpliceAI-MANE! Better annotation, better results!
.. 2. If you want to do splicing research in other species, the OpenSpliceAI has you covered! It comes with models pretrained on various species! And you can easily train your own SpliceAI with your own genome & annotation data.
.. 3. If you are interested in predicting the impact of genetic variants on splicing, OpenSpliceAI is the perfect tool for you!

.. |

.. What does OpenSpliceAI do❓
.. ====================================

.. * The OpenSpliceAI :code:`create-data` command takes a genome and annotation file as input and generates a dataset for training and testing your SpliceAI model.

.. * The OpenSpliceAI :code:`train` command uses the created dataset to train your own SpliceAI model.

.. * To avoid retraining your SpliceAI model from the ground up, the OpenSpliceAI :code:`fine-tune` command allows for the fine-tuning of the pretrained human model using your own created dataset. It tailors the model to better generalize to your specific species.

.. * The OpenSpliceAI :code:`predict` command takes a random gene sequence and predicts the score of each position, determining whether it is a donor, acceptor, or neither.

.. * The OpenSpliceAI :code:`variant` command takes a VCF file and predicts the impact of genetic variants on splicing.
