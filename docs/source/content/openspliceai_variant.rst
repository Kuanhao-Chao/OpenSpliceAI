.. _variant_subcommand:

variant
=======

The ``variant`` subcommand evaluates the impact of genomic variants (SNPs and small INDELs) on splice sites by comparing model predictions on the reference (wild-type) sequence to predictions on the altered (mutant) sequence. It annotates a VCF file with “delta” scores for four events—acceptor gain, acceptor loss, donor gain, and donor loss—along with the relative position of each event. These delta scores reflect how much the mutation modifies the model’s predicted splice site strength and location.

|

Overview
--------

Similar to SpliceAI’s variant annotation approach (Jaganathan et al., 2019), the ``variant`` subcommand:

- **Parses** a user-provided VCF file.
- **Retrieves** the reference genome context from a FASTA file.
- **Loads** a trained OpenSpliceAI model (PyTorch *or* Keras).
- **Predicts** splice site probabilities for both wild-type and mutated sequences.
- **Computes** the maximum change in donor or acceptor probability (delta scores) within a fixed window (default ±50 nt) around each variant for each event.
- **Outputs** an annotated VCF, including delta scores and delta positions for each allele.

|

Input Files
-----------

1. **VCF File**

   A standard VCF file containing variants (SNPs, small insertions, and deletions).

2. **Reference Genome (FASTA)**

   A FASTA file used to extract wild-type sequences. The subcommand checks that the reference allele in the VCF matches the reference genome.

3. **Annotation File**

   A *custom* gene annotation file that defines the genomic regions to consider. Variants outside of annotated genes or too close to the chromosome ends (by default, within the flanking region) are skipped.

4. **Trained Model Checkpoint(s)**

   A directory or file containing one or more OpenSpliceAI model checkpoints (PyTorch ``.pt`` or Keras ``.h5``). The subcommand can average predictions across multiple models.

|

Output Files
------------

The primary output is a **VCF file** with added OpenSpliceAI annotations for each variant that passes filtering. Only SNVs and simple INDELs (REF or ALT is a single base) within genes are annotated. Variants in multiple genes have separate predictions for each gene. Each variant line in the annotated VCF contains a string in the ``INFO`` field with the format:

.. code-block:: text

   ALLELE|SYMBOL|DS_AG|DS_AL|DS_DG|DS_DL|DP_AG|DP_AL|DP_DG|DP_DL

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 85
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description
   * - ALLELE
     - Alternate allele
   * - SYMBOL
     - Gene symbol
   * - DS_AG
     - Delta score (acceptor gain)
   * - DS_AL
     - Delta score (acceptor loss)
   * - DS_DG
     - Delta score (donor gain)
   * - DS_DL
     - Delta score (donor loss)
   * - DP_AG
     - Delta position (acceptor gain)
   * - DP_AL
     - Delta position (acceptor loss)
   * - DP_DG
     - Delta position (donor gain)
   * - DP_DL
     - Delta position (donor loss)

- **Delta Scores**: Acceptor gain, acceptor loss, donor gain, and donor loss. The scores range from 0 to 1, and can be interpreted as the probability of the variant being splice-site-altering.
- **Delta Positions**: Relative positions (±50 by default) of these maximum changes. Positive values are downstream, negative values are upstream.

For example,
.. code-block:: text

   A|MYGENE|0.27|0.00|0.09|0.02|3|-4|7|-2

This string shows:
- Alternate allele is A
- We are on MYGENE
- The base positon 3 downstream of the variant has the highest acceptor gain score of 0.27
- The base position 4 upstream of the variant has the highest acceptor loss score of 0.00 (no loss)
- The base position 7 downstream of the variant has the highest donor gain score of 0.09
- The base position 2 upstream of the variant has the highest donor loss score of 0.02

Delta Score Computation
-----------------------

The “delta” score measures how much a mutation changes splice site predictions within a fixed window around the variant (default ±50 nucleotides, adjusted by ``-D`` parameter). For each variant, we compute reference predictions (:math:`d_{ref}`, :math:`a_{ref}`) and alternative predictions (:math:`d_{alt}`, :math:`a_{alt}`) for donor (:math:`d`) and acceptor (:math:`a`) channels:

.. math::
   \mathrm{DS}(\mathrm{Acceptor\,Gain}) = \max\bigl(a_{alt} - a_{ref}\bigr)
   :label: eq:12

.. math::
   \mathrm{DS}(\mathrm{Acceptor\,Loss}) = \max\bigl(a_{ref} - a_{alt}\bigr)
   :label: eq:13

.. math::
   \mathrm{DS}(\mathrm{Donor\,Gain}) = \max\bigl(d_{alt} - d_{ref}\bigr)
   :label: eq:14

.. math::
   \mathrm{DS}(\mathrm{Donor\,Loss}) = \max\bigl(d_{ref} - d_{alt}\bigr)
   :label: eq:15

where each maximum is taken over a window of 101 positions (±50) centered on the variant. The position of the maximum difference is recorded as the “delta position” (negative if upstream of the variant, positive if downstream).

Examples
--------

Example: Discovering pathogenic human variants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

   openspliceai variant \
      --input-vcf input_variants.vcf \
      --ref-genome GRCh38.fa \
      --annotation grch38.txt \
      --model /path/to/pytorch_models/ \
      --model-type pytorch \
      --flanking-size 400 \
      --distance 100 \
      --mask 1 \
      --output-vcf annotated_variants.vcf

This command:

1. **Loads** the reference genome from ``GRCh38.fa``.
2. **Reads** the gene annotation from ``grch38.txt``.
3. **Scans** the directory ``/path/to/pytorch_models/`` for PyTorch checkpoints, averaging predictions from all found models.
4. **Computes** donor and acceptor delta scores within ±100 nucleotides of each variant.
5. **Masks** scores representing annotated acceptor/donor gain and unannotated acceptor/donor loss. (This is useful for novel/pathogenic variant discovery).
6. **Writes** a new VCF (``annotated_variants.vcf``) with the masked annotations for the four delta scores and positions in the ``INFO`` field.

      --model-type keras \
      --flanking-size 10000 \

      --precision 3

This command:

1. **Loads** the reference genome from ``GRCh37.fa``.
2. **Reads** the gene annotation from ``grch37.txt``.
3. **Scans** the directory ``/path/to/keras_models/`` for Keras checkpoints, averaging predictions from all found models.
4. **Computes** donor and acceptor delta scores within ±50 nucleotides of each variant.
5. **Writes** a new VCF (``annotated_samples.vcf``) with all annotations for the four delta scores and positions in the ``INFO`` field (these are unmasked by default, so all scores are included). The scores are rounded to three decimal places.

Processing Pipeline
-------------------

#. **VCF Parsing/Filtering**

   - For each variant, the subcommand checks if it lies within an annotated gene region. If it isn't, it will be filtered out.  
   - Variants that are too close to the chromosome ends (< ``flanking-size`` / 2 bases on either side), have deletions of length > 2 * ``distance``, or have reference alleles mismatching the FASTA are automatically skipped.

#. **Reference & Mutant Sequence Extraction**

   - A window of :math:`2 \times \text{dist_var} + 1` around the variant is extracted from the FASTA (e.g., 101 nt for ``--dist-var=50``).
   - For each alternative allele, the subcommand constructs a mutant sequence by substituting the variant base(s).

#. **Model Loading & Prediction**

   - The user may supply **PyTorch** (``.pt``) or **Keras** (``.h5``) model checkpoints.  
   - If a directory is provided, predictions from each model are averaged.  
   - Wild-type (reference) and mutant sequences are one-hot encoded and fed into the model(s) in evaluation mode.

#. **Delta Score Calculation**

   - The difference in donor/acceptor probabilities (:math:`d_{alt}-d_{ref}`, :math:`a_{alt}-a_{ref}`) is computed across the window.  
   - The maximum positive or negative differences yield the four delta scores: donor gain, donor loss, acceptor gain, and acceptor loss (Equations :eq:`eq:12`–:eq:`eq:15`).

#. **VCF Annotation**

   - The four delta scores and their positions (relative to the variant site) are appended to each variant’s INFO field.  
   - The annotated VCF includes the annotations in the ``INFO`` field, following the string format described above.

Conclusion
----------

The ``variant`` subcommand enables fine-grained analysis of how single-nucleotide changes or small variants affect splice site usage. Essentially, it provides a convenient, post-hoc annotation step for variant effect prediction.
