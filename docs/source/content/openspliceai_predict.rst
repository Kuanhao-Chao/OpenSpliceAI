.. _predict_subcommand:

predict
=======

The ``predict`` subcommand uses a trained OpenSpliceAI model to identify potential splice sites in user-provided DNA sequences. It accepts either a standalone FASTA file or both a FASTA and GFF (annotation) file to determine genomic coordinates for protein-coding genes. This command outputs **BED files** for donor and acceptor sites, optionally storing intermediate predictions in HDF5 or PyTorch format for later analysis.

|

Overview
--------

Once an OpenSpliceAI model is trained (via the :ref:`train_subcommand` or :ref:`transfer_subcommand`), the ``predict`` subcommand:

- **Loads** a reference genome in FASTA and, optionally, a GFF file to focus on specific gene regions.
- **Splits** large sequences into manageable chunks (``--split_fasta_threshold``).
- **One-hot encodes** the sequence data with flanking regions (size determined by ``--flanking-size``).
- **Runs** inference on each chunk in a batch-wise manner (with a batch size derived from the flanking size).
- **Generates** final BED files, separating donor and acceptor sites exceeding a user-defined score threshold.

|

Input Files
-----------

1. **FASTA File**

   A FASTA file containing sequences for which you want to predict splice sites.  
   If a GFF file is also provided, only the genomic regions marked as “gene” in the GFF are extracted for prediction.

2. **GFF File** (Optional)

   A GFF3 annotation file. If supplied, the tool extracts protein-coding gene regions from the FASTA for more targeted prediction.

3. **Trained Model Checkpoint(s)**

   A PyTorch checkpoint (``.pt``) file (state dictionary) from a trained OpenSpliceAI model, or a directory containing multiple of these files (for ensemble prediction, where it will return the average across all models).

|

Output Files
------------

- **Donor and Acceptor BED Files**:  
  Two BED files listing genomic coordinates (if GFF supplied, else absolute coordinates) and scores for splice sites.  
  - ``acceptor_predictions.bed``
  - ``donor_predictions.bed``

- **Intermediate Files** (depending on parameters):
  - **HDF5 Files**: One-hot-encoded sequences and/or raw predictions.
   - ``datafile.h5``: Raw extracted sequences
   - ``dataset.h5``: Batched input for prediction
   - ``predict.h5``: Raw predictions from the model (if ``--predict-all``)
  - **Extracted FASTA**: Refined versions of the input FASTA are created with overlapping regions to avoid missing predictions at chunk boundaries.
   - ``[name]_genes.fa``: FASTA file containing only gene regions (if GFF provided)
   - ``[name]_split.fa``: Split FASTA file (if any sequence in the input FASTA exceeds the ``--split-threshold``)

Examples
--------

Example: Predicting splice sites for human genes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

   openspliceai predict \
      --model /path/to/model_best.pt \
      --input-sequence GRCh38.fa \
      --annotation-file GRCh38.gff \
      --flanking-size 400 \
      --threshold 0.6 \
      --output-dir ./prediction_output/

This command:

1. **Extracts** gene regions from ``GRCh38.fa`` using coordinates in ``GRCh38.gff``.
2. **Splits** large sequences exceeding the default threshold into manageable chunks.
3. **One-hot encodes** each chunk with a 400-nt flanking region.
4. **Loads** the specified model, runs inference in turbo mode, and outputs predictions directly to BED files.
5. **Writes** donor and acceptor sites with probability > 0.6 into two BED files.

|

Example: Predicting all splice sites in sample
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

   openspliceai predict \
      --model /path/to/model.pt \
      --input-sequence sample.fa \
      --flanking-size 10000 \
      --predict-all \
      --output-dir ./prediction_output/

This command:

1. **Processes** the entire ``sample.fa`` file.
2. **Splits** sequences longer than the default threshold into smaller chunks.
3. **One-hot encodes** each chunk with a 10,000-nt flanking region.
4. **Loads** the specified model and runs inference.
5. **Writes** all raw predictions to the output directory in HDF5 format.
6. **Generates** BED files for all predictions (technically, all predictions > 1e-6).



Processing Pipeline
-------------------

#. **Sequence Extraction & Splitting**

   - If a GFF file is provided, the subcommand creates a new FASTA containing only gene features (type = "gene").  
   - Large sequences (exceeding ``--split-threshold``) are split into overlapping fragments to avoid missing predictions at boundaries.

#. **One-Hot Encoding**

   - Each sequence is padded with :math:`\frac{\text{flanking-size}}{2}` on both ends using 'N's.  
   - Overlapping windows of length 5,000 + ``flanking_size`` are created, ensuring every base is covered.  
   - Sequences are grouped into chunks of size ``--chunk-size`` to manage memory usage.

#. **Model Loading**

   - The specified PyTorch model checkpoint is loaded onto the best available device (GPU if available, otherwise CPU).  
   - If multiple models or an ensemble directory is provided, predictions are averaged across all valid checkpoints (must be saved as a ``.pt`` file).

#. **Batch Prediction**

   - A DataLoader object feeds chunked, one-hot-encoded sequences to the model in batches, with the batch size set based on the flanking size.  
   - Predictions are aggregated either:
     - **Standard Mode** (``--predict-all``): Full predictions are stored in an HDF5 (or PyTorch) file before BED conversion.
     - **Turbo Mode** (default): Predictions are converted on-the-fly to BED entries without storing them fully.

#. **BED File Generation**

   - For each base in the sequence, the tool outputs donor or acceptor entries to two separate BED files if they exceed ``--threshold``.  
   - Coordinates are derived from:
     - **GFF** (if provided), yielding genomic coordinates.
     - **FASTA** headers, if no GFF is present (coordinates are then relative to the start of the FASTA entry).
   - The final result is two BED files:
     - ``acceptor_predictions.bed``
     - ``donor_predictions.bed``

Conclusion
----------

The ``predict`` subcommand is the final step of the OpenSpliceAI pipeline, taking raw DNA sequences (FASTA) and a trained model and giving interpretable splice site predictions quickly and at big scales.
